# VGAMERZ-DataProject
This project was made for a mock company VGAMERZ who are into game development of all kinds for several years.
In this project the client gave us a data sheet of 16k+ records to produce a Performance Dashboard on Tableau. (Dashboard link: https://public.tableau.com/views/VGAMERZDashboard/FinalDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The client finally posed 2 questions: which is their best console/platform and best genre. This project answers those 2 questions with data and viz to back them.
